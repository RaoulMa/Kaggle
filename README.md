# Kaggle
Jupyter notebooks for several kaggle competitions. The data sources are not provided, but can be downloaded from the kaggle platform. You can also visit my kaggle profile https://www.kaggle.com/raoulma for updates. 

### Nuclei Segmentation for the Data Science Bowl 2018
This Jupyter notebook implements a U-Net shaped convolutional neural network in TensorFlow for nuclei segmentation of the images provided by the 2018 Data Science Bowl.

### Breast Cancer Image Classification
Image classification of cancerous breasts with 80% validation accuracy. This script won a kaggle kernel prize. 

### Plant Seedlings Classification
Using a pretrained Xception model achieves 90.06% accuracy on the test set.

### MNIST Classification
Using a CNN achieves 99.51% test set accuracy.

### House Price Prediction
Regression of sale price of houses achieves 0.11710 root-mean squared error.

### Titanic Survival Classification
Given is a training set of 891 samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster. The goal is to construct a model that can predict from a test dataset of 418 passengers not containing the survival information if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not. This is a supervised classification task.

### NY Stock Price Prediction
This notebook demonstrates the future price prediction for different stocks using recurrent neural networks in tensorflow. Recurrent neural networks with basic, LSTM or GRU cells are implemented.
